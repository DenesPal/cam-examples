# Kubernetes templates

Templates for testing deployment onto Kubernetes clusters with Cloud Application Manager.

Each directory is a different deployment, with multiple template files. There
is a .yaml file with the same name that also includes the same templates but concatenated.

You can import these templates directly into Cloud Application Manager by:

1. Create a Template Box with type Kubernetes
2. Create a new template, chose URL, and paste the GitHub URL of the template file / directory, and Cloud Application Manager will improt them automatically.

Have fun!
