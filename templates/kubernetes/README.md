# Kubernetes templates

Templates for testing deployment onto Kubernetes clusters with Cloud Application Manager.

Each deployment has a directory with multiple template files, and a single-file version of the concatenated templates here in this upper level directory.

You can import these templates directly into Cloud Application Manager by:

1. Create a Template Box with type Kubernetes
2. Create a new template, chose URL, and paste the GitHub URL of the template file / directory, and Cloud Application Manager will improt them automatically.

Have fun!
